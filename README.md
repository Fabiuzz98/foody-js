BUILT WITH:
This application has been made with JavaScript, HTML and SCSS.

DESCRIPTION OF THE APP:
The user can insert food names in the search bar and thanks to the Forkify API will get back all the recipes including the searched food.
If the recipes are more than 10, a button will appear to move back and forth between the different pages to see all the recipes available.
It's then possible to bookmark your favourite recipes to save them for the future.
Another feature of this app is that you can also add your own recipes that will be then automatically bookmarked.
You can decide to bookmark and unbookmark all the recipes you want and in this last case if you remove a recipe you created from the saved recipes, you will still be able to find it (thanks to the API key) by typing its name in the search bar.
You recognise the bookmarked recipes in the list thanks to an icon that will appear next to the recipe name.
